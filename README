This is a multilingual natural language generator I wrote for my final year project at Cambridge.

All source code in this repository is hereby licensed under the GPL v 3 license. Please contact david.stark@zarkonnen.com for further information. The Downloads area contains a compiled version of the generator and a PDF of the dissertation I wrote on it.

NB that the data folder and input.txt need to be next to the jar of the generator for it to function. Also see command line options detailed in Generator.java.

There is also an applet version at http://beardy.pod.me.uk/applet.html .
